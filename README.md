   In order to get functioning your application, you need to install Redis, and start redis-server.
   
   Also, I've wrote test cases for different scenarios.
   
   Then, you need to import this project as a Gradle project. 
   
   After importing, you need to choose Run as Spring Boot App.

   Applogies for about 50-60 Megs more, but I've thought that will be interesting to include my Gatling configs, a test scenario which can be executed with a test.bat file(also included), and the results of simulation. The test scenario use a .csv file with some URLs as a feeder, and in a random manner, it process one by one a chosen URL. As you can see from "gatling/results/simulationstresstest-URL/index.html", my application can have more than 30 active users at a single time.
